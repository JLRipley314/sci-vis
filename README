scientific visualization functions in python3

dependencies:
- numpy
- h5py
- pyqtgraph

There are two different functions for 1D and 2D data that read
from hdf5 files.

To call 1D plotter type:	
	python plotter_1d_hdf5.py

To call 2D plotter type:	
	python plotter_2d_hdf5.py

buyer beware: this software is still very much a work in progress
