scientific visualization functions in python3

Alex Pandya wrote an earlier version of this software for
visualizing 1 dimensional time dependent data.

dependencies:
- numpy
- h5py
- pyqtgraph

There are two different functions for 1D and 2D data that read
from csv or hdf5 files.

buyer beware: this software is still a work in progress
